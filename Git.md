# What is Git and how it works

## What is it Git 

Git is a popular distributed version control system. With Git, developers can track changes to their code over time, collaborate with other developers, and easily revert to previous versions if necessary. Git allows developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously, with each developer having their own copy of the code on their local machine. Changes made by each developer can then be merged into a shared repository, allowing the entire team to stay up-to-date with the latest changes.

## How to make repository in Git

1. Open the terminal

2. Enter the command "git init" to initialize the repository. This will create a new repository in the current directory.

3. Add any files you want to include in the repository to the staging area using the command git add _filename_

4. Commit the files to the repository using the command "git commit -m 'Initial commit'" This will create the first version of your repository with the files you added in the previous step.

## Most usefull Git commands 

One of the most useful commands in Git is git status. This command shows the current state of your Git repository and helps you keep track of changes made to your files. It displays information such as which files have been modified, which files are staged for commit, and which files are not being tracked by Git.

# Other usefull commands

* **git add**: adds changes to the staging area

* **git commit**: commits changes to the repository

* **git push**: pushes changes to a remote repository

* **git pull**: pulls changes from a remote repository

* **git branch**: creates branches

* **git checkout**: switches between branches or restores files

* **git merge**: merges changes from one branch to another

* **git log**: displays the commit history

* **git diff**: shows differences between files or commits
