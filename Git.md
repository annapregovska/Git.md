# What is Git and how it works

## What is it Git 

Git is a popular distributed version control system. With Git, developers can track changes to their code over time, collaborate with other developers, and easily revert to previous versions if necessary. Git allows developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously, with each developer having their own copy of the code on their local machine. Changes made by each developer can then be merged into a shared repository, allowing the entire team to stay up-to-date with the latest changes.
